ulimit -c (this will show the maximum limit for the core), try man X later
ulimit -c unlimited (sets core limit to unlimited) have to do it everytime unless its in bashrc
These lets us get our core file. After we get this we can debug using gdb
Now to start gdb, either normally run the program which gives us a core dump if we get segfault. THEN 
$ gdb "executable file name" core 
This starts gdb prompt.
gdb> bt 
(stands for backtrace)  
shows details of segfault. 

**REMEMBER TO DELETE YOUR CORE FILE EVERYTIME YOU CHANGE YOUR CODE AND COMPILE**
sometimes you won't get line numbers if you don't ^ (remember your compile needs -g)
